MHT633 8 colors

{6,3,3} 8 colors.
It has 8 cells. Each cell is a {6,3} 7-color
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szilassi_polyhedron
7 hexagons {6}
21 edges 6*7/2 = 21
14 vertices 7*6/3 = 14

The whole shape has 
8*7/2 = 28 2C face pieces
8*21/3 = 56 3C edge pieces
8*14/4 = 28 4C vertex pieces

8-color Solution:
===
1. Solve 2C. 3-cycle is possible. Flipping 2 pieces is possible.
- Gather one color first (blue). Then move on to another color (red)
- [Parity] If we need to swap 2 pieces, make a 6-fold rotation to correct

2. Solve 3C. 3-cycle is possible. Possible to flip 2 pieces in place, or rotate 1 piece in place (cycle all three stickers)

3. Solve 4C. 3-cycle is possible. Possible to rotate 2 pieces in place ( 3-cycle stickers on each piece ), or double flip two pairs of stickers on one piece.

It's posted that we may see a parity in both 3C and 4C. Fortunately I didn't see the 3C parity

4. 4C parity: At the end of orientation fixing of 4C pieces, you may see a 3-fold parity. Make one 3-fold rotation and re-solve. The 3-fold rotation is not to directly fix the piece, but to rotate in the opposite way. I recorded the whole fixing sequence as a macro, so that we can apply it or the inverse of it.

At the beginning of the first 3-fold parity: 12913
At the end of the attempt to fix 3-fold parity: 20710

Analogy:
{5, 3, 3} has 120 cells. 
Each cell (dodecahedron) has 

{5,3} dodecahedron has 12 faces {5}
5*12/2 = 30 edges
5*12/3 = 20 vertices

the whole {5,3,3} shape has:
120*12/2=120*6 = 720 2C faces
120*30/3=1200 3C edges
120*20/4=600 4C vertices
